# Yale-Tekagami-jo
This github repository is intended to track editorial development of the online publication and hosting of the _tekagami j≈ç_, an album of Japanese calligraphy fragments from the 8th-18th centuries held at the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library at Yale University.

This repository is managed by Mary Gilstad, a researcher of the album and the managing editor of the project website on the _researcher side_ of the project. There is also a team of software developers affiliated with Yale University Library who work on the technical side.
